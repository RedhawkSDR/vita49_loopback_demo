# REDHAWK Basic Waveforms - Vita49 Loopback Demo
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK Basic Waveform - Vita49_loopback_demo. This waveform uses the sourceVITA49 and sinkVITA49 components to demonstrate how VITA49 network data can move into and out of REDHAWK.

## Build/Installation Instructions
This is a wavform project and thus does not need to be built just installed into the SDRROOT/dom/waveforms directory. One way to do that is to open the project in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR Folder.
